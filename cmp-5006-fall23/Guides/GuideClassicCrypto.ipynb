    "# Work Guide: Classical Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Research Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will research various classical cryptography topics. Each topic has a set of questions to guide your learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Shift Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is the shift cipher and how does it work?\n",
    "  Shift cipher is a symmetric encryption method that is based on character substitution.\n",
    "  In this method, each letter of the original message is moved a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, if the fixed number is 3, the letter A becomes D,    B becomes E, and so on, also known as the Caesar cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. How can you encrypt and decrypt messages using the shift cipher?\n",
    "   To encrypt and decrypt messages using shift cipher, you need to follow the following steps:\n",
    "  Select a fixed number of positions you want to move each letter of the original message in the alphabet. This number is known as the **encryption key**.\n",
    "  Type the original message you want to encrypt.\n",
    "  For each letter in the original message, it moves the letter a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. \n",
    "  If the fixed number is 3, the letter A becomes D, B becomes E.\n",
    "  Another example if the fixed number is 6, the letter A becomes G, B becomes H, so on.\n",
    "  The encrypted message is the sequence of letters resulting from applying encryption in turn to each letter of the original message.\n",
    "  To decrypt the message, you simply apply shift cipher with the reverse key. For example, if the key is 3, you must move each letter 3 positions to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What are the limitations and vulnerabilities of the shift cipher?\n",
    "Keep in mind that shift cipher is very easy to implement and understand, but it is also very vulnerable to brute force attacks.\n",
    "A brute force attack involves trying all possible key combinations until you find the right one. Therefore, round-robin encryption is not suitable for protecting sensitive information\n",
    "Additionally, round-robin encryption has several limitations. For example, if the fixed number of positions used to shift letters is very small, the cipher can be easily cracked using frequency analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Can you provide an example of a real-world application of the shift cipher?\n",
    "A historical example of the use of the turn-based cipher is the Caesar cipher, which was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his generals 1. Another historical example is the cipher used by Mary Queen of Scots to send secret messages to her supporters.\n",
    "Currently, round-robin encryption is mainly used for educational purposes and to demonstrate the vulnerability of simple ciphers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. How does the shift cipher relate to modular arithmetic?\n",
    "Round-robin encryption can be related to modular arithmetic because the shifting of each letter of the original message is performed by a modular operation. In particular, if the fixed number of positions used to shift letters is n, then the ith letter of the original message becomes the (i + n) mod 26th letter of the alphabet\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Substitution Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is the substitution cipher and how does it differ from the shift cipher?\n",
    "A substitution cipher is a type of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter or symbol. The substitution can be based on a fixed pattern or a random permutation. In contrast, a shift cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. How can you create a substitution cipher using a keyword or a random permutation?\n",
    "Choose a keyword and remove any duplicate letters.\n",
    "Write the remaining letters of the alphabet in order after the keyword.\n",
    "Assign each letter in the alphabet to a unique letter in the keyword and write them down in a table.\n",
    "Use this table to encrypt and decrypt messages.\n",
    "For example, if we choose the keyword “BING” and remove any duplicate letters, we get “BINGACDFHJKLOMPQRSUVWXYZ”. We can then assign each letter in the alphabet to a unique letter in the keyword as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plaintext Letter\tCipher Letter\n",
    "            A\tB\n",
    "            B\tI\n",
    "            C\tN\n",
    "            D\tG\n",
    "            E\tA\n",
    "            F\tC\n",
    "            G\tD\n",
    "            H\tF\n",
    "            I\tH\n",
    "            J\tJ\n",
    "            K\tK\n",
    "            L\tL\n",
    "            M\tO\n",
    "            N\tM\n",
    "            O\tP\n",
    "            P\tQ\n",
    "            Q\tR\n",
    "            R\tS\n",
    "            S\tT\n",
    "            T\tU\n",
    "            U\tV\n",
    "            V\tW\n",
    "            W\tX\n",
    "            X\tY\n",
    "            Y\tZ\n",
    "            Z\tE\n",
    "#### 3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the substitution cipher?\n",
    "The advantages of substitution ciphers include their simplicity and ease of use. However, they are vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks, where an attacker can analyze the frequency of letters in the ciphertext to determine the substitution pattern \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. How can frequency analysis be used to break a substitution cipher?\n",
    "Frequency analysis can be used to break a substitution cipher by analyzing the frequency of letters in the ciphertext and comparing them to the frequency of letters in the plaintext language. For example, if an attacker knows that “E” is the most common letter in English, they can look for the most common letter in the ciphertext and assume that it corresponds to “E” \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Can you provide an example of a historical use of the substitution cipher?\n",
    "A historical example of a substitution cipher is the Caesar cipher, which was used by Julius Caesar to communicate with his generals 4. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Affine Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is the affine cipher and how does it combine the shift and substitution ciphers?\n",
    "combines elements of both the shift cipher and substitution cipher. In the affine cipher, each letter in the plaintext is mapped to a new letter based on a mathematical formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses two main components, a key pair (a, b), where:\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' is a multiplicative factor\n",
    "'b' is an additive factor\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. How can you encrypt and decrypt messages using the affine cipher?\n",
    "To encrypt a message using the affine cipher, we first map each letter in the plaintext to its corresponding numeric value. We then apply the encryption function to each numeric value, which gives us the corresponding numeric value of the ciphertext. Finally, we map each numeric value back to its corresponding letter in the ciphertext alphabet.\n",
    "E(x) = (ax + b) mod 26\n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt a message using the affine cipher, we first map each letter in the ciphertext to its corresponding numeric value. We then apply the decryption function to each numeric value, which gives us the corresponding numeric value of the plaintext. Finally, we map each numeric value back to its corresponding letter in the plaintext alphabet.\n",
    "D(y) = a^(-1). (y - b)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What are the advantages and vulnerabilities of the affine cipher?\n",
    "Advantages are larger key space comparted to the previous and simpler ciphers, more complex encryption using modular arithmetic. Some disanvantages are linear structure makes it vulnerable attacks and to frequency analysis modular arithmetic patterns can reveal information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. How can you break the affine cipher using known plaintext attacks?\n",
    "First the attack gathers known plaintext and corresponding ciphertext pairs, sets up equations based on the known pairs utilizing the cipher's linear formula. Then solves equations to find the corresponding keys and with this it can decrypt the other ciphertexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Can you provide an example of a practical use of the affine cipher?\n",
    "An example of practical use for an affine cipher could be in computer graphics software where affine transformations are used to manipulate images \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The Hill Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is the Hill cipher and how does it differ from previous ciphers?\n",
    "The Hill cipher a more advanced cryptographic technique than previous ones like shift, substitution, and affine ciphers. It works on blocks of letters using matrix math, making it resistant to frequency analysis. The encryption key is a matrix, making it more complex and secure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. How can you encrypt and decrypt messages using the Hill cipher?\n",
    "The encryption process involves dividing the plaintext into blocks of n letters, where n is the size of the key matrix. Each block is then multiplied by a matrix, modulo 26, to obtain the corresponding ciphertext block. The decryption process involves multiplying each ciphertext block by the inverse of the key matrix, modulo 26, to obtain the corresponding plaintext block. \n",
    "\n",
    "####  3. What are the advantages and limitations of the Hill cipher?\n",
    "The Hill cipher has several advantages over other ciphers such as its resistance to frequency analysis attacks and its ability to encrypt multiple letters at once. However, it also has some vulnerabilities such as its susceptibility to known plaintext attacks and its requirement for an invertible key matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. How does the Hill cipher utilize matrix operations?\n",
    "It utilizes for both encryption and decryption because the key is a matrix. When we convert the plaintext in numerical numers and into a block we have to multiple this with the matrix or key using standard matrix multiplication rules. Also for decryption we have to calculate the inverse of the key a typical operation used with matrixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Can you provide an example of a real-world application of the Hill cipher?\n",
    "Application in military and diplomatic communications. During World War II, the Hill cipher was used by some military entities to encrypt sensitive messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. The Permutation Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is the permutation cipher and how does it work?\n",
    "El cifrado de permutación, también conocido como cifrado de transposición, es una técnica criptográfica que reorganiza el orden de los caracteres en el texto sin formato para formar el texto cifrado. No cambia los personajes en sí, sólo sus posiciones. Este método proporciona una capa adicional de complejidad al cifrado.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. How can you encrypt and decrypt messages using the permutation cipher?\n",
    "To encrypt a message using the permutation cipher, we first choose a keyword and split the plaintext into blocks that are the same length as the keyword. We then write these blocks in columns beneath the keyword and label each keyword letter in alphabetical order. We then reorder the columns so that the numbers are in order (the letters of the keyword are in alphabetical order). Finally, we read across the rows to obtain the corresponding ciphertext block.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt a message using the permutation cipher, we have to write out the ciphertext in columns (the same number as the length of the keyword). We then order the keyword alphabetically, and write the ordered keyword at the top of the columns. We then rearrange the columns to reform the keyword, and read off the plaintext in rows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the permutation cipher?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. How can you break the permutation cipher using brute force or frequency analysis?\n",
    "#### 5. Can you provide an example of a historical use of the permutation cipher?\n",
    "\n",
